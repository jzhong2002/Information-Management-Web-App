Issue 1:
the delete button in the 'Members' Page, 'Penalty' Page, and 'Manage Staff' in the admin panel they don't work 

Issue 2:
the profile edit for admin doesn't work, and the admin is not able to update the details and the profile image. And the profile name for admin is hardcoded so it doesn't update itself by whoever is logged in.

You might have to add more pages to the admin panel if you want to allow admin to delete records but not the staff.

Thank you Bence!
